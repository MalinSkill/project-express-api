# Project Express API
Build an API in Node using Express. Deploy it on for example Google cloud.
It should have a minimum of 2routes. It shoudl be RESTful.


## The problem

It was a bit tricky to decide what routes to create. But after thinking about it for a while I decided to just try and get as much practice as possible with routes, endpoints and query params.
This week was very valuable in getting to actully build what we have previously just used in the frontend to fetch data.
I got a better understanding of the connection and the possibilities to adapt the API depending on the usage in the frontend.
I look forward to learn more and also to implement this in a project were I also create the frontend for it.
