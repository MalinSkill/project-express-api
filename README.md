# Project Express API
Build an API in Node using Express. Deploy it on for example Google cloud.
It should have a minimum of 2routes.


## The problem

Building the API with different endpoints, using different javascript methods to manipulate the data.

Also learned how to use query params to show filtered/specific search result.

I did not create any frontend for this project. But I look forward to building API when I know the specific use it will have frontend. To implement this new knowledge for something more concrete.

I choose to go for a dataset with Netflix data. 

It was also valuable this week to get a better understanding of the different status code you can choose from.
